Cross-platform playlist creator

Description: \
This python project will allow you to create a Spotify playlist by 
linking a YouTube playlist and vice vera. This project utilizes the Spotify
and YouTube api in order to receive the necessary information and to create the playlists for both platform. In addition,
I used a python library from GitHub called YouTube_dl to better obtain the title and author of the songs from the YouTube playlist
in order to find the songs on spotify.\


Motivation: \
My motivation for creating this project is because many times I will switch from using Spotify and YouTube when listening
to music. Due to this YouTube creates playlists for me that I enjoy, but when I switch to Spotify, I don't want to spend
so much time transferring that music over. Thus, this project will make this process much easier and allows me to listen
to all my favorite songs on both platforms.
